## Tutorials
When I learn something new I like to challenge myself trying to explain it to somebody else like showing how to get over the learning obstacles I found. Also I think it is a way to better stimulate my recall months later, when I'll have forgotten almost everything ðŸ˜….  
Here are some of my notes of this kind.  

* [The Model Evaluation Game](https://gist.github.com/gianfa/4a370517e963d8cd6bd1bb3246ed68ad#file-ml-learn-model_evaluation-md) A sort of simple board-game tules to play with peaple who want to better understand the Machine LEarning Model Evaluation basics. ![ML Stage](https://img.shields.io/badge/-MachineLearning-blue.svg)
