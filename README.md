# Interests
[Neuro & geeknering](https://www.facebook.com/neuromachinebrain/). It's a fb page that I opened with some friends to publish news about brain, and sciences and technologies related to it.

# Utilities
Here I'll put some links to some tools I made in the past, for personal purposes or work.

## Ombro cinema online
Tool to create a nice ombroCinema picture. Still in alpha version, need some adjustment. I created this for the master thesis work of a friend of mine, Bilgesu Dogan, Designer.
