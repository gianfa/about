## Tutorials
When I learn something new I like to challenge myself trying to explain it to somebody else like showing how to get over the learning obstacles I found. Also I think it is a way to better stimulate my recall months later, when I'll have forgotten almost everything ðŸ˜….  
Here are some of my notes of this kind.
